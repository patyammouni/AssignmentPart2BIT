        <h1>Quiz System</h1>

        <p>
            The quiz system is designed to be a final test for the user to prove
            that they understand the lessons in the modules. After finishing a module the user
            will be guided to a quiz based on that module, as the target audience for the website are young
            children the quiz will have a simple multiple choice formatting. When the user has submitted their
            answers for the quiz the system will process these answers and display the results to the user, with
            the user required to meet a certain amount of correct answers to be awarded a pass for the module. As
            SafeMe is focused on the education of the user, we will try and ensure that users will not be disheartened
            by failing marks and will use it as an opportunity to teach the user how to correct their mistakes. The questions
            for the quiz will be a small randomised subsection of a pool of appropriate questions, this is to ensure that the
            user is being tested on their actual understanding of the subject and not just their memorisation of the questions.
