        <h2>User Story:</h2>
        <p>
            Christopher is a 13 year old and had recently been made aware of potentially having a virus after he was
            taken to a strange window when he clicked on an advertisement, listing the types of virus that are on his
            computer. This has led Christopher to safeme.com as he wants to learn more about internet safety, where he
            has been going through the modules and completing the quizzes. However Christopher has been struggling with
            retaining the knowledge he has learnt and has found that the pop-up function has assisted him with getting
            further into the modules as extra information is being provided on sections that can be difficult to
            understand and it has also reinforced some of the other modules to assist Christopher in maintaining his
            knowledge he has learnt.

            As you may be able to see there is a red pointer hovering of the ‘Cyber Security’ text. This will enable a
            box to pop up and display one of the following, interesting facts or reinforcing information from another
            module. This will also be used throughout the module information as well as other areas of the website.
