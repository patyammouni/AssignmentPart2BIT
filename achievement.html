    <h1>Achievement System:</h1>
	<p>The achievement features is designed and built to provide the student/user of the site a form of verification and validation to their work. At the end of completing the test/quiz for their module and successfully passing the attempt they will be directed to a page where they can then submit their Full name and email address where a document will be automatically filled with their info and emailed to them with their info in the certificate. The system will also validate user input by making sure the name entered is contains only letters and various other symbols and letters for naming through the use of a regular expression. This will also be done for validating email addresses by using an sufficient regular expression to ensure an email address contains the basic format as such example@example.com. </p>

	<p>My name is Matthew and I am an avid user of the internet and its features but I actually am unaware of all these ‘things’ that go on in the background of the internet. I want to study and gain knowledge of this and achieve something from it. I also want to prove to my teacher and family that they shouldn’t worry about me spending all my time on the internet because I have learnt about it!</p>
