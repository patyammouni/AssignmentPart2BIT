                    The quiz feature is one of the most core items in this project. Reason being, it is the one and only
                    way to know if the child learning has got the concept well and has not just glimpsed it. For this
                    feature, we are looking forward to create a Quiz that is totally a page on its own so that the
                    child cannot refer to the module pages and complete. As this will have put no effect on the childs
                    understanding. Therefore, similar systems have been reviewed and this seemed to be one of the major
                    issues, which we are looking forward to dodge and ensure the child has the knowledge.

                    <br>

                    One the challenging parts faced could be PHP as the team has minimum knowledge regarding this but
                    look forward to learn and implement a successful solution.

                    As per research and every education institutions understanding, it is obvious that students
                    understand best through interactive learning practices, this is known as engagement learning where
                    the student is presented with fun material and activities that help adapt to information at a very
                    high rate. Thus, we chose the interactive module as a must included feature.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When considering this similar systems were referred to including the RMIT canvas system on how
                    inofrmation is presented. But since our case has involvement with young children, we have decided to
                    go with a children theme that shall attract them and they shall have fun learning.

                    Due to having only a satisfied level of HTML knowledge it required me to do research and learn the
                    types of ways I could begin coding the pop-up feature. This could enable me to look at a variety of
                    different websites with pop-up pages and inspect how they had gone about coding their version of a
                    pop-up, hence why I have the learning and researching part taking the longest in this process.
                    Furthermore, I would have to look at a variety of designs that had been used as well as ensuring the
                    colour of the pop-up box is suitable to the colour scheme of the website which should take a little
                    longer than actually coding and testing it as a result of it not being too complex. This now leads
                    to me assuming that coding and testing taking similar times as I would need to ensure I have code it
                    correct and review it during the testing stage to ensure it is doing what the group wants it to as
                    well as the positioning of where it should pop-up and ensure it has displayed text on the box.

                    Children are innocent and tend to adapt things taught at a very young age for the rest of their
                    life. Therefore, we have decided to go with the achievement system. This is important as it would
                    play a psychological role on a child as they get rewarded, they look forward to get an extra mile so
                    that they can get a reward. this is a great practice for children to adapt which makes them hard
                    working and dedicated to something.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Therefore, the achievement feature plays a large role again. Similar systems were reviewed but the
                    team came up with an idea that anyone completing these modules should get a certificate that can be
                    very helpful for them in the future. So we are looking forward and excited to come up with such a
                    feature and put a smile on the young faces.

                    This feature is more of the parent involvement feature in any environment not everyone is
                    comfortable with public speaking or revealing their identity in some areas. Therefore, we decided
                    that this would be one of the best ways to give a chance to people to have a say. This will help us
                    take some notes to consider and give feedback, improvement and solutions where needed.
